# An Extensible Parallel Programming Framework for ableC
This extension provides implementation-agnostic syntax and back-end support for
for various parallel programming tools. It also contains several implementations
(which are included here for compactness but are independent extensions) as well
as some extensions built on top of this system (which again are independent
extensions).
